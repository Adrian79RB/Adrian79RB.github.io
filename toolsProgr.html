                <p>
                    I have experience working in the development of tools in the different projects that I have joined.<br> 
                    Most of this experience is working within the environment of some game engines such as Unreal and Unity,<br>
                    where I have used the facilities that give these engines to modify the visual aspect of the editor and <br>
                    make up certain functionalities for the design team that make the game development easier. However, I have <br>
                    develop other tools as external apps outside those game engines environments, I have some experience working <br>
                    with C# in Windows Forms IDE, where I have developed some apps that do some external jobs easier such as QA and <br>
                    Testing for instance, an app to repeat certain kinds of inputs performed by the tester.<br><br>
                    
                    Most of these apps and tools were oriented to make some work aspects of the design and art teams easier, mostly <br>
                    focusing on introducing new assets or data to the game. Some examples of these tools are: an easy menu inside <br>
                    the editor to introduce new conversation assets that let the design team write faster, a tool to repeat games using <br>
                    the user input, a tool to track the game development stats while the player is playing, etc.

                    Here you have the link to the projects where you can appreciate all these projects, watch demostrative videos about the tools functioning and take a look to the code in github.
