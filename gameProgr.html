                <p>
                    I have experience working in the development of game aspects in the different projects that I have joined. <br><br>
                    Most of this experience is working within the environment of some game engines such as Unreal and Unity, where I have used components oriented programming and hierarchies of actors. In this projects I have used coding languages 
                    as C++ and C# modified to work in these environments. However, I have develop other games and apps outside those game engines environments, I have some experience working with C# in Windows Forms IDE, where I have developed
                    little games and some apps that are used as tools. In addition, I have developed some apps using Kotlin/Java inside the Android Studio IDE. These projects were oriented to run in a mobile environment so I have experience 
                    working with a low budget of device power.<br><br>
                    In those projects I worked in gameplay and UI aspects. I usually work developing the logic in the game such as: the fighting system, puzzle system, the AI agents that confront 
                    the player, spawning systems, etc. In some of these projects I created some conversation systems based on the player's progress.<br><br>
                    On the other hand, I have experience working with UI in games, either in the games' menu or in-game HUD. 
                    Some examples of these designs are creating dialogs systems, stats and life systems, punctuation systems, turn-based fights menus, etc.

                    Here you have the link to the projects where you can appreciate all these projects, watch demostrative videos about the gameplay aspects and take a look to the code in github.
